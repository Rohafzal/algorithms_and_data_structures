    "In this solution, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the first duplicate value in a binary tree, and we introduce a helper function to dynamically construct the binary tree from a level-order input array. This helper function makes it easier to test the algorithm with various inputs.\n",
    "Steps to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Helper Function: Tree Construction The helper function takes a level-order input list (e.g., [1, 10, 2, 3, 10, 12, 12]) and builds the binary tree dynamically.\n",
    "It uses a queue to track parent nodes and assigns left and right children in a level-order manner.\n",
    "For each element in the input: If the value is not None, create a new TreeNode and assign it as the left or right child of the current parent node.\n",
    "Enqueue the newly created child node for further processing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the tree is constructed, we use BFS to find the first duplicate value in the binary tree:\n",
    "Initialize a queue with the root node.\n",
    "Use a set to track the values of nodes already visited.\n",
    "For each node:\n",
    "Check if its value exists in the set: If yes, return the value (this is the first duplicate found). Otherwise, add the value to the set.\n",
    "Add its left and right children (if they exist) to the queue for further processing.\n",

    "Why Use This Alternative?\n",
    "Dynamic Tree Construction:\n",
    "The helper function allows the binary tree to be built dynamically from level-order input, making the solution flexible and testable for various inputs.\n",

    "Efficiency:\n",
    "BFS ensures the first duplicate closest to the root is found in O(n) time.\n",
    "The set-based duplicate check is efficient with O(1) average-time complexity.\n",
    "It has a space complexity of O(n)\n",
