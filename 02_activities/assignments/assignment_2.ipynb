Second, marking the presence of numbers in the cache also involves iterating through the input list, which is another O(n). Finally, identifying the missing numbers by scanning the cache array takes O(m), where m is the size of the range [0, n]. Since mâ‰¤n, this step also effectively takes O(n), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n)\n",

    "The solution is efficient with O(n) time complexity but uses an integer-based list 'cache' that tracks frequency, which is unnecessary for this problem since only presence of an integer (present or absent) matters. This issue can be tackled by usingo a simpler boolean array. A boolean array would reduce memory usage, eliminate unnecessary increment operations, and make the code more intuitive and focused on presence checks. Additionally, edge cases like empty lists or negative numbers are already handled, but replacing the integer cache with a boolean array would make the solution cleaner, more efficient, and better suited to the problem."

    "The first assignment focused on finding duplicates in a binary tree, and I approached the problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy. By traversing the tree level by level and maintaining a set to track seen values, I efficiently identified the first duplicate. This approach operated with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity, ensuring optimal performance by checking for duplicates as each node was processed. Coming up with new examples to better understand the problem and striving to find a solution with the best time and space complexity helped me write the code more efficiently and confidently. Constructing the binary tree manually for testing further validated the solution and helped me grasp its behavior with different tree structures.\n",

During the review, I appreciated their feedback on potential edge cases, such as handling larger trees or alternative traversal techniques. Discussing my approach helped me reflect on its strengths, including its clarity and scalability, while also emphasizing the importance of clear communication in collaborative problem-solving. Overall, the process of presenting and reviewing my solution enhanced my understanding of the problem and reinforced the value of peer collaboration in improving both my code and my ability to explain solutions effectively"
